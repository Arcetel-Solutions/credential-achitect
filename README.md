## 🧠 Inspiration

This project was inspired by a real-world problem observed while working with our first client **Paviona**, owned by **Mr. Vincent Kurauvone**.

He manually wrote hundreds of vouchers by hand from MikroTik-exported CSV files.  
That inefficiency inspired us to build a **simple, free, and powerful tool** to automate the process.
