## ❤️ Project Background & Inspiration

Credential Architect was inspired by a real-world problem.

One of our earliest clients, **Paviona**, owned by **Mr. V. Kurauvone**, manually wrote vouchers on paper.  
This sparked the realization that **voucher generation could be automated**.

Initial experiments started with web technologies, but Python’s flexibility and powerful libraries ultimately made this project possible.
